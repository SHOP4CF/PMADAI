# User stories VWP Pilot 1

1. As a user, I want to be able to check work statuses of current
    painting processes in KTL are, so I can have more control. Work
    statuses include following characteristics

    - Identifiers: Skid ID, Pendulum ID, Car body ID, Car body TYPE,
        Voltage program TYPE
    - Time of entering the KTL process (timestamp)
    - Time of leaving the KTL process (timestamp)
    - Time of cleaning / repair of SKID (timestamp - available from
        SKID Management Tool) (\*)
    - Painting cycles count
    - Services count

2. As a user, I want to receive alert about detected incorrect painting
    process in the KTL area, so I can further check the possible
    malfunction.

3. As a user, I want to be able to perform a detailed check of a given
    painting process in the KTL area (including visual inspection of
    current on busbars), so I can have more control.

4. As a user, I want to be able to verify detected incorrect painting
    process in the KTL area or verify any given painting process, so I
    can manage maintenance needs for skids and pendulums.

5. As a user, I want to be able to observe painting of cage in the KTL
    area, so I can have clearer view of situation (it should be
    distinguished in UI).

6. As a user, I want to receive alert about incorrect data describing
    painting process in the KTL area (e.g., lack of data for a given
    busbar), so I can check possible malfunction.

7. As a user, I want to be able to check data describing paining
    processes in the KTL area (e.g., view of data describing paintings
    involving given skid: statistical information, visualizations,
    detected anomalies), so I can inspect possible problems.

    Further on (if possible)

8. As a user, I want to receive alert about maintenance need for a
    selected skid, so I can prevent malfunction of painting process in
    KTL area.

*Considered users*: operators, process maintenance workers and
management - for now we do not make a distinction of roles in the pilot.
